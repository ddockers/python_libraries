# Collections

Collections are a way to store multiple items in a single variable.

## Lists

A list is exactly what it sounds like (it is called an array in other programming languages).

Lists are ordered, mutable and allow duplicate values.

Here's how you create a list:

```commandline
shopping_list = ["bread", "onions", "cheese", "butter"]
```
